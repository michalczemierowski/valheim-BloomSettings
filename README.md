# Bloom Settings

This mod allows players to change bloom effect settings.

## Configuration
1. Intensity (-1 to skip this setting) (default = *-1.0*)
   - The strength of the Bloom filter
2. Threshold (-1 to skip this setting) (default = *1.6*)
   - Filters out pixels under this level of brightness
3. Soft knee (-1 to skip this setting) (default = *0.3*)
   - Makes a gradual transition between under/over threshold. 0 is a hard threshold while 1 is a soft threshold.
